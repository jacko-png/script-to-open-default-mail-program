What this script is for
=======================
• This script is used to run the default mail application on Windows.
• I have this in %PATH% so that I can Run mail to open my mail program, which has changed a few times recently.

I was feeling quirky and wrote the file in uppercase. Feel free for contributions to be in lowercase. Also, IFs don't need to have C-style brace indentation, Java-style will do fine.

You may notice that I use the Unicode bullet point /U2022 rather than a character like \*. Get with the times, gramps.
